This code tutorial presents the QIIME2 data analysis pipeline for 16S and ITS samples.
The pipeline begins with zipped, trimmed, and demultiplexed samples; and takes the analysis through importing, filtering, phylogeny, taxonomy, and diversity metrics.
Additional diversity visualizations were produced using R and the QIIME2R suite of packages and tools. This additional .R code will be linked in a future update.
